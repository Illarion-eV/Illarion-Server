There may be legacy code violating the listed guidelines, new code however has to be compliant.

By order of precedence:
Illarion Coding Style: https://github.com/vilarion/Illarion-Coding-Style
C++ Core Guidelines: https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md

Some formatting rules are reflected by .clang-format, you can apply these as needed with clang-format.
Suitable editors allow you to automatically apply these rules on saving a file.

New code must not add more clang-tidy warnings under the following rules:
cppcoreguidelines-*
modernize-*
bugprone-*
performance-*
readability-*
clang-analyzer-api*
clang-analyzer-core*
clang-analyzer-cplusplus*
clang-analyzer-dead*
clang-analyzer-fuchsia*
clang-analyzer-nullability*
clang-analyzer-optin*
clang-analyzer-security*
clang-analyzer-unix*

New code must not add more cppcheck warnings, unless these are known false positives.
