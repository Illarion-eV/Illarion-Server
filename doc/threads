The server runs four threads:

1. The main game loop in main.cpp

2. InitialConnection::run_service in InitialConnection.cpp
   - waits for new incoming connections

3. PlayerManager::loginLoop in PlayerManager.cpp
   - handles player login

4. PlayerManager::playerSaveLoop in PlayerManager.cpp
   - handles player logout
